# AES
This GitHub repository contains a basic Python implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm, which is a widely used symmetric-key encryption algorithm for securing data. The code in this repository provides a complete implementation of AES-128 bits encryption.

# Working
1. Open final_aes.py
2. Make changes for secret key (16 characters) & plaintext (16 characters)
3. Run final_aes.py

# Contributions
This is just a basic implementation of AES & hence there are not a lot of features. 
So contributions to this repository are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository, make modifications, and submit pull requests to improve the code or add new features.
